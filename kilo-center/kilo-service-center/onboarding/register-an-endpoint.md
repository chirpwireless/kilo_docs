# Register an Endpoint

### Goal

Create an endpoint in KiloCenter so it can be attached by a base station and exchange traffic.

### Prerequisites

* KC-Core, KC-Gateway, and KC-Web running
* At least one base station connected (see Connect a Base Station)

### Required Fields

| Field      | Format                             | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `epEui`    | 16-character hex string (8 bytes)  | Unique endpoint identifier. Must match the hardware EUI. |
| `name`     | Free text                          | Human-readable label for the endpoint.                   |
| `nwkSnKey` | 32-character hex string (16 bytes) | Network session key for frame authentication.            |
| `shAddr`   | Integer                            | Short address assigned to the endpoint.                  |

These values come from the endpoint provisioning process. The EUI and network session key must match what is programmed into the endpoint hardware.

### Register Through KC-Web

1. Open KC-Web at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. Navigate to **Endpoints** in the sidebar.
3. Click **Add Endpoint**.
4. Fill in the required fields:
   * **EUI**: the 16-character hex EUI (e.g., `0011223344556677`)
   * **Name**: a descriptive label
   * **Network Session Key**: the 32-character hex key
   * **Short Address**: the assigned short address
5. If the endpoint supports bidirectional communication, enable the **Bidirectional** flag.
6. Save the endpoint.

### Validate Endpoint State

After registration, the endpoint should appear in the **Endpoints** list with a registered status. Once a base station performs an attach operation for this endpoint, the status will update to reflect the active connection.

### Optional MIOTY Profile Fields (Enterprise Edition)

The MIOTY specification defines additional endpoint profile fields that control radio behavior. These fields are available in the Enterprise Edition:

| Field         | Type    | Description                       |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `dualChan`    | Boolean | Dual channel mode                 |
| `repetition`  | Boolean | Downlink repetition               |
| `wideCarrOff` | Boolean | Wide carrier offset               |
| `longBlkDist` | Boolean | Long downlink interblock distance |

In the Community Edition, these fields use default values and are managed automatically by KC-Core during the attach process.

### Common Failures

| Symptom                            | Likely Cause                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Invalid EUI" error                | EUI is not exactly 16 hex characters                                  |
| "Duplicate endpoint" error         | An endpoint with this EUI already exists                              |
| Endpoint stays in registered state | Base station has not yet attached this endpoint                       |
| Uplinks not appearing              | Network session key mismatch between endpoint hardware and KiloCenter |
