# Connect a Base Station

### Goal

Connect a MIOTY base station to your local KiloCenter instance and confirm it is online.

### Prerequisites

* KC-Core, KC-Gateway, and KC-Web running (see Installation)
* BSSCI reachable on port `5000`
* Server CA certificate available at `kilocenter-modules/KC-Core/certificates/ca.crt`

### Step 1: Create the Base Station in KC-Web

Before the hardware can connect, the base station must exist in KiloCenter.

1. Open KC-Web at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. Navigate to **Base Stations** in the sidebar.
3. Click **Add Base Station**.
4. Enter the base station **EUI** (16-character hex string matching the hardware identity) and a **name**.
5. Save the base station.

### Step 2: Configure Base Station Hardware

Point the base station firmware to your KiloCenter host:

* **Service Center address**: your KC-Core host IP or hostname
* **Service Center port**: `5000` (BSSCI)
* **Protocol**: TLS (required)

For AVA base stations, the factory login is `ubuntu` / `123456`. Change these credentials after initial access.

### Step 3: Import CA Certificate

The base station must trust KiloCenter's CA certificate for TLS to succeed.

1. Copy `kilocenter-modules/KC-Core/certificates/ca.crt` to the base station.
2. Import it into the base station's TLS trust store through its configuration interface.

### Step 4: Verify Connection

#### In KC-Web

Navigate to **Base Stations**. The connected base station should show an **Online** status.

#### In Logs

```bash
tail -f kilocenter-modules/logs/runtime/kc-core.log
```

A successful connection produces log entries showing:

* **Version negotiation** -- KC-Core and the base station agree on BSSCI protocol version
* **Attach operations** -- the base station registers its endpoints with KC-Core

Look for entries containing `versionNeg` and `attach` with no error messages.

#### Common Connection Failures

| Symptom                       | Likely Cause                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No connection attempt in logs | Base station not pointing to correct host/port                  |
| TLS handshake error           | CA certificate not imported or certificate mismatch             |
| Connection drops immediately  | Base station EUI not registered in KC-Web                       |
| Version negotiation fails     | Firmware version incompatible with KC-Core BSSCI implementation |
