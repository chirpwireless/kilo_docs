# License And Trademarks

### License

KiloCenter Community Edition is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later** (AGPL-3.0-or-later).

The full license text is available in the LICENSE file in the repository root, and at [gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

### What AGPL Means for Hosted Modifications

The AGPL extends GPL with a network-use clause:

* If you **distribute** KiloCenter binaries, you must provide the source under AGPL.
* If you **run a modified version as a network service**, you must make the complete corresponding source available to users of that service.
* You may link to the source or provide a direct download — the requirement is that users can obtain it.

Source code is always available at [github.com/Kiloiot/KiloServiceCenter](https://github.com/Kiloiot/KiloServiceCenter).

### Runtime Source Disclosure

The `GetReleaseInfo` gRPC RPC returns disclosure metadata at runtime, including:

* `edition` — build edition (e.g., "Community Edition")
* `license_id` — SPDX identifier (e.g., "AGPL-3.0-or-later")
* `license_url` — link to full license text
* `source_url` — link to source repository
* `documentation_url` — link to documentation
* `homepage_url` — project homepage
* `trademark_notice` — trademark statement

This information is also embedded in the web UI (login page, navigation drawer, and user menu) so users can always locate the source and license.

### Trademark Policy
