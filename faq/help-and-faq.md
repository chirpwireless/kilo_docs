<summary>Why aren’t Data Chips being counted or why are they being counted slowly?</summary>

* Reason 1: Someone nearby may have scanned the networks, or the signal quality of these networks was poor. Not all networks (100%) can be counted, especially if they’ve been scanned in the last 24 hours.

- Reason 2: Scanning the same networks within a 24-hour period won’t add extra Data Chips. The system filters out duplicate networks to ensure accurate data collection.

</details>

<details>

<summary>My Data Chips disappeared or reset. Why?</summary>

Data Chips were not reset for anyone. This issue may occur if your internet connection is unstable, preventing the app from updating your Data Chips information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can’t I see my points in the Chirp browser?</summary>

Data Chips are only displayed in the app. The website dashboard is designed for Blackbird miner owners, not for Kage users.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can’t I see Data Chips on the website dashboard?</summary>

Data Chips are only displayed in the app. The dashboard is intended for Blackbird miner owners, not Kage users.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I enter the referral code of the person who invited me?</summary>

You can enter a referral code when you first launch the Kage app. If you’re already logged in, you won’t be able to enter the code.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why weren’t my referrals counted?</summary>

There are several possible reasons:

1. The person didn’t enter the referral code during registration.
2. They entered the code incorrectly.
3. They entered the code but didn’t click the "Confirm" button and instead clicked "Skip."

</details>

<details>

<summary>It seems like my app isn’t working or detecting networks. What should I do?</summary>

Try the following:

1. Reinstall the app completely.
2. Reboot your phone.
3. Scan for networks in a different location, such as walking around the city.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The app prompts me to update, but there’s no update button on Play Market. What should I do?</summary>
